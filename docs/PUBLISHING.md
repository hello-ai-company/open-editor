# Static publishing

`@hello-ai-company/editor-publish` provides `renderOpenEditorSite(document, options)` and `getPublicKnowledgeContext(document, options)`. The host decides which document is public, persists publication settings, configures hosting, and supplies optional title/description/canonical/Open Graph URLs.

The renderer accepts a fixed semantic block allowlist, omits hidden/private/internal content and unknown blocks, escapes text and attributes, and accepts only safe image URLs. It emits responsive semantic HTML and SEO metadata without scripts, iframes, arbitrary HTML, or arbitrary CSS.

`getPublicKnowledgeContext` returns `trust: "untrusted"`; keep published text separate from trusted model instructions because public content can contain prompt injection.

## Known projection limits

Inline marks and hyperlinks are not preserved; unknown blocks are omitted. Review the output before publication. The package does not implement DOCX, PDF, or Markdown export, a shared Export IR, navigation, hosting, visitor analytics, Ask This Page, CSP headers, or deployment.
